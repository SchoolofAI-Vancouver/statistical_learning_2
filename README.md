## Installation Requirements

Instead of working in R, as in the book, we will do the applications in Python.

It is recommended that you use either [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true) or [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).

## Resources

The meetup covers Chapter 3 and 4 from the book, *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*. The book can be downloaded [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf), but has been added to this repo, [here](https://github.com/SchoolofAI-Vancouver/statistical_learning_1/blob/master/docs/An%20Introduction%20to%20Statistical%20Learning%20-%20Gareth%20James.pdf), for convenience.

The book gives R application code snippets. However, we will be working in Python. The Python code snippets for the book can be found [here](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python).

## Code Challenge

**Due Date:** Sunday, 4 November @ midnight (PST)

**Challenge:** Explore a dataset of your choice and document your most interesting findings. Use the Python exploration functions discussed in the meetup (e.g. the summarizing and visualizing functions).

*Check out the **Applied** section under **2.4 Exercises** in **An Introduction to Statistical Learning** for inspiration.*

**Everyone is encouraged to participate!**

The winning submission should ideally contain:

* interesting, well-motivated, findings
* documentation explaining your exploration

To submit, post your submission's repository link on the `# coding_challenge` Slack channel (on the Vancouver School of AI workspace) before the due date.
